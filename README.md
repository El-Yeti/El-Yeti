Say, can you see
By the dawn's eaely light
What so proudly we hailed
At the twilight's last gleaming?
Whose broad stripes and bright stars
Through the perilous fight
O'er the ramparts we watched,
Were so gallantly, yeah streaming?
And the rocket's red glare
The bombs bursting in air
Gave prooof through the night
That our flag was still there
Oh say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave
O'er the land of the free and at the home of the brave
